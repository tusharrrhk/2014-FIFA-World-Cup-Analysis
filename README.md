## üìå **Recommendations**

- Midfielders were key contributors in the tournament. Teams should invest in training versatile midfielders who can influence both attack and defense.
- A mix of experienced players (26‚Äì35 years old) and younger talents ensures strategic depth, leadership, and energy, which are critical for success in high-pressure matches.
- With 185 yellow cards and 10 red cards issued, teams should focus on improving defensive discipline to minimize fouls while maintaining competitive performance.
- Since most matches were played between 1 PM and 5 PM, teams should tailor training sessions to match these conditions, focusing on heat management and maintaining stamina.
